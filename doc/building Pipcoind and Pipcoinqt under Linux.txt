Build for Linux
If you prefer to compile your own binaries, then you need development packages:

Ubuntu / Debian:
 sudo apt-get install git qt4-qmake libqt4-dev build-essential libboost-dev libboost-system-dev
   libboost-filesystem-dev libboost-program-options-dev libboost-thread-dev
   libssl-dev libdb ++ - dev libqrencode-dev

If you experience an error when you install qt4-qmake (Occurs on Ubuntu 14.04.2, and possibly in other versions)
libcheese-gtk23: Depends: libclutter-gtk-1.0-0 (> = 0.91.8) but it is not going to be installed
                  Depends: libcogl15 (> = 1.15.8) but it is not going to be installed
libcheese7: Depends: libclutter-gst-2.0-0 (> = 0.10.0) but it is not going to be installed
             Depends: gstreamer1.0-clutter but it is not going to be installed
libclutter-1.0-0: Depends: libcogl-pango15 (> = 1.15.8) but it is not going to be installed
                   Depends: libcogl15 (> = 1.15.8) but it is not going to be installed

Then type
sudo apt-get install libglew-dev libcheese7 libcheese-gtk23 libclutter-gst-2.0-0 libcogl15 libclutter-gtk-1.0-0 libclutter-1.0-0 xserver-xorg-input-all

openSUSE (tested on version 13.2):
 sudo zypper install git gcc gcc-c ++ libqt4-devel boost-devel libopenssl-devel libdb-4_8-devel libqrencode3

After the installation is complete, you can clone a repository PipCoin

 git clone https://github.com/PipCoin-project/PipCoin.git

and finally to compile your client

 cd PipCoin
 qmake USE_O3 = 1 USE_ASM = 1 (if you want LevelDB, the USE_LEVELDB = 1)
 make
 cd src
 make -f makefile.unix USE_O3 = 1 USE_ASM = 1 (if you want LevelDB, the USE_LEVELDB = 1)
 strip PipCoind

Teams above compiled binary files with dynamic linking, if you want to static linking, and your distribution includes a static library (.a, .so instead), add:
-to command qmake:
 RELEASE = 1
-to command make -f makefile.unix:
 STATIC = 1

If you want to reduce the size of binary files,
1) Visit the website http://upx.sourceforge.net/#downloadupx
2) Download the program in accordance with your system
3) Extract the program to a folder with binary files PipCoin.
4) Type in the terminal
./upx -9 PipCoind
then
./upx -9 PipCoin-qt

And your PipCoind and PipCoin-qt will be less than ~ 3 times.
